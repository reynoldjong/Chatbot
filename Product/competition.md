# Competition
Currently, DFI wishes to have a chat bot which essentially creates a single go to source for reliable information about the FinTech echo system.  In the initial requirements, DFI has outlined the following key concerns: ability to expand its knowledge, ability to learn about its users, user creation, indexer for new formation, crawler, and query system.  Based on this criteria we have examined products that can fill similar needs.

### IBM Watson

| Criteria | Details |
| ------ | --------- |
| **Product Name** | IBM Watson |
| **Website** | https://www.ibm.com/watson |
| **Price** | 10,000 api calls are free monthly |
| **Product** | IBM Watson is an IBM supercomputer which uses AI and analytical software to “answer questions”.  It has the ability for natural language processing (querying) to display relevant documents or search results(indexing) and can learn about its users (training).  It has the ability to be expanded on via ‘skills’ and can be used in a wide variety of scenarios such as diagnosing cancer, being used as a shopping assistant etc. This service also the option for account creation. |
| **What it can't do** | IBM Watson does not feature a web crawler.  Since IBM Watson is a really ‘smart’ super computer having this device crawl potentially thousands of web pages could lead to security issues and storage issues with the amount of information it could be storing. |
| **Target Market** | IBM Watson is a highly sophisticated AI which as seen above can be used in a large plethora of scenarios.  Because of its uses this product is useful for larger businesses dealing with either more complex information or a lot of it.  It is for companies with programmers available as there is no visual ai builder.  |


### LivePerson

| Criteria | Details |
| ------ | --------- |
| **Product Name** | IBM Watson |
| **Website** | https://www.liveperson.com/ |
| **Price** | Need to call in to get information on price |
| **Product** | AI solution which handles various aspects of ecommerce (credit checks, question answering, etc.) and natural language messaging as well as having a simple way to manage how the bot is operating.  The knowledge base of the bot can be configured by uploading csv files which contain various specified meta data and is then trained (https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-knowledge-base.html).   |
| **What it can't do** | This solution does not have any sort of crawler.  This is the case because the product wants to focus on a person’s store and the owner of the store should have all information regarding how the store operates so this service has no need for a crawler. Additionally, LivePerson does not have the opportunity to create user accounts and cannot learn more about the user as the interaction continues.  This would be extremly costly for the company to implement as the technology is not in place and secondly because it strays from their main business.  Currently the company wishes to automate simple routine tasks and as a result the chat bot does not need to learn more about the user. |
| **Target Market** | This product is for businesses who want to either automate or create a live service in which the bot can automate routine tasks (such as opening credit cards, applying for loans) or provide a way to answer consumer questions.  It is not mean't for companies deailing with a large amount of information. |

### WotNot

| Criteria | Details |
| ------ | --------- |
| **Product Name** | WotNot |
| **Website** | https://wotnot.io/ |
| **Price** | Free option available |
| **Product** |WotNot is boasts itself as being a simple to use and highly customizable chatbot which can integrate itself on any platform.  The chatbot works by making using of csv files for its data and conversations can be edited through a spread sheet. |
| **What it can't do** | This chatbot is not designed to be used as an full fledged automation tool but more of an assistant.  It also has no crawler so all data must be inputted through csv files.  With the goal of this chatbot service to be simple to use and easy to integrate anywhere it makes sense that for the sake of simplicity they do not have crawling which can add another layer of complication. |
| **Target Market** | This product is for start-ups or small companies that wish to automate simple routine tasks and for those that have no experience programming.  For instance, this product can be used to automate interactions with prospective clients or locate “actionable information”. |

### Motion ai

| Criteria | Details |
| ------ | --------- |
| **Product Name** | Motion.ai |
| **Website** | https://www.motion.ai/ |
| **Price** | Flat fee of 800$ for 1000 uses and a variable cost of 50$ per 1000 uses |
| **Product** |Motion AI offers a visual chatbot builder so that businesses can better engage their customers.  This service is boasts itself on being easy to use and works by creating messaging channels which is essentially a conversation tree.  This services offers the ability to create accounts which allows the chat bot to maintain user context and thus learn about the user. |
| **What it can't do** | This chat bot faces a major limitation in that it is not able to index or crawl new data.  Instead the conversation build takes over everything and any uploading of data is left aside.  The company chose to do this to focus purely on a chatbot that interacts with others that is very simple to use so as a result the took away the data and focused on conversation flows.  It would be very costly for this company to implement user data into their chatbot as now the conversation flows would become more complex and they would need to account for a variety of data. |
| **Target Market** | This product is for companies that focus on customer interaction and are of a small size with no programmers.  This product would be used for things such as user account creation, finding a certain product for a customer etc.  Ultimately the end user is for someone without any programming experience. |

After our analysis our team has determiend that IBM Watson is the closet competitor.  This is because IBM Watson is highly scalable, can take in a large amount of data and can learn more about the user through its account creation system.
